# Simple Todo App

A basic todo application built with Node.js and Express.

## Features

- Add new todos
- Mark todos as completed
- Delete todos
- Simple and clean interface

## How to run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

3. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`

## Files

- `app.js` - Main server file
- `public/index.html` - Main HTML page
- `public/style.css` - Styling
- `public/script.js` - Frontend JavaScript
- `package.json` - Project dependencies

The app stores todos in memory, so they will be lost when you restart the server.
